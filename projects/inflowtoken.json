  "summary": "INFLOW Token is the Engagement Token of the INFLOW Engagement Ecosystem, bringing Influencers to Life. The Ecosystem is rooted in INFLOW Network. Since its foundation in 2016, INFLOW Network has become the World’s leading Influencer Marketing (IM) community, hosting 1,000+ of the most powerful Influencers with a collective reach of +250 million Followers. This gives the Ecosystem immediate scale. In today’s IM Industry, Influencers are value drivers. Follower volume measures Influencer value. Brands pay Influencers to reach Followers. The more Followers, the more Influencer value, the more Brands pay. Albeit Followers fuel this industry, they are not financially participants. INFLOW Token corrects this imbalance, providing unique utility as the currency of the Engagement Marketplace, allowing Influencers to sell personal Engagement Offers to their Followers; i.e. having coffee, taking lunch, or watching events together. Followers are then rewarded for their participation. Brands benefit from a deeper involvement with both parties and rich quantitative data. INFLOW Token, through the Engagement Marketplace, strengthens the relationships between all parties, introduces a new engagement economy and optimizes the dynamics of the IM Industry using the Avalanche platform.",
