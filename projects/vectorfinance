“summary”: Vector Finance is a protocol that synergistically integrates with Platypus Finance and Trader Joe. Vector enables users to generate boosted yields on their stablecoins or JOE LP deposits, even if they don’t own any PTP or JOE. Vector is able to do this by aggregating PTP and JOE from users who choose to convert their PTP or JOE on our platform. In doing so, Vector unlocks utility for the PTP and JOE tokens: users who convert their PTP into xPTP, or their JOE into zJOE receive a portion of the yield generated by the protocol. This allows for better capital efficiency and a more diverse user base for Platypus and Trader Joe. VTX (Vector's governance token) receives a share of Vector's revenue (~33.3%) and unlocks the highly sought after voting power from PTP or JOE holders who may not be as concerned with governance. VTX is rewarded to xPTP and zJOE stakers, stablecoin and JOE LP depositors, and liquidity providers for our tokens.
