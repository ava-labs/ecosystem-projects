More than a game, it is an \"arcade\" where multiple game planets exist and users can build their own mini-games levels as well as compete in them with others.\nArcade Galaxy targets a wider audience than typical crypto-earning games. Combining aesthetics and intuitive gameplay with the chance to earn and own digital property, users can profit from creativity as well as skill.",
