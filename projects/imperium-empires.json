  "summary": "Imperium Empires is the first AAA-quality MMORTS space metaverse on Avalanche, built by accomplished game devs with 10+ yrs experience. Funded by top-tier VCs such as GBV Capital and Three Arrows Capital, Imperium Empires is set to revolutionize blockchain gaming through its AAA-quality graphics and gameplay, well-thought-out tokenomics design, guild mechanics and deep DeFi integration. Imperium Empires solves 4 major problems commonly seen in other blockchain games: (i) low-quality graphics and limited gameplay - simply put, no fun for play-to-earn; (ii) hyperinflationary and unsustainable tokenomics - with no NFT burn mechanisms, NFT supply inflates exponentially through breeding, so play-to-earn rewards drain fast and collapse as the number of players grows; (iii) lack of guild-based gameplay that bonds guild members together and retain players in the long term; and (iv) lack of deep DeFi integration except for liquidity-mining-styled single sided staking.",
