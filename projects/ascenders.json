  "summary": "Ascenders is an original multiplayer open-world Action RPG that brings forward influences from Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Eve Online, forging them into a fresh and stunning immersive experience and catapults them into the dynamic crypto gaming scene. The result is a new multi-platform science-fantasy world filled with danger, adventure, and exotic horizons - all to be explored and mastered. Ascenders will feature a revolutionary game economy that reimagines what a multiplayer RPG would look like if fully decentralized, and built entirely around DeFi concepts. Players would be able to trade resources in a global marketplace, creating a user-driven, self-sustaining economy.",
