  "summary": "Umbria Network is a DeFi ecosystem which enables the cheapest and fastest transfer of assets (bridging) between Ethereum and other networks, such as Avalanche. It reduces the cost of bridging by a factor of 10 by introducing a novel liquidity lending protocol. The Umbria Network bridge uses crowd-lended assets to facilitate bridging assets across cryptocurrency networks (such as Ethereum Mainnet ---> Avalanche Mainnet), and offers liquidity lenders extremely high APYs as a reward, with no impermanent loss. The liquidity lending protocol also reduces the cost of bridging by up to a factor of 10 by optimising the number of necessary on-chain operations required to securely bridge funds cross-chain.",
